# Visualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees
### A DataQuest Guided Project

This is a little visualization project that looks at the gender gap in degrees awarded in different majors in the US between 1970 and today.  There is not much to the project beyond the visualization, but there are some interesting (if tentative) conclusions to be drawn, and a number of interesting questions to consider.  Perhaps I will pursue those questions in the future, but different data would be necessary.

This [dataset](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/) is derived from annual results released by The Department of Education statistics, which was cleaned and prepared by Randal Olsen from the University of Pennsylvania
